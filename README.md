# 2D-harmonic-oscillator-and-Lissajous-figures
Is presented the solution of a simple harmonic oscillator with two degrees of freedom, and the contruction of Lissajous figures.

The Lissajous curve is the graph of the system, corresponding to the superposition of two simple harmonic motions in perpendicular directions.
